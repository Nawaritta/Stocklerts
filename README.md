## The context

Stock trading is the heartbeat of the global economy, where companies, investors, and traders engage in a dynamic dance that shapes 
the financial landscape. It's a world of constant flux, where market movements can impact fortunes and financial destinies in the blink
of an eye. For individuals navigating this intricate web, keeping abreast of stock developments is not merely a choice but a necessity.

### The Challenge of Staying Informed

For many individuals, especially those without dedicated financial advisors, staying informed about stocks can be both expensive and 
time-consuming. Monitoring a diverse portfolio of stocks demands constant attention to news, financial reports, and market trends. 
Subscribing to premium services or hiring financial experts can add significant costs, making comprehensive stock monitoring a luxury 
for some.

### Real-Time Updates, Effortlessly Delivered

__Stocklerts__ monitors stocks on your behalf. It eliminates the need for constant vigilance, allowing you to focus on your life while
still making informed investment decisions.
Imagine receiving alerts when significant news related to the stocks you follow breaks. __Stocklerts__ enables you to respond swiftly and 
make decisions that align with your financial goals. 

## Project Overview

__Stocklerts__ derives its name from the combination of 'stock trading' and 'news alerts.' As the name suggests, the core idea of the project
is to provide users with real-time stock price data and pertinent news, facilitating informed decision-making. 

The application is not a substitute for professional financial advice, stock market predictions, or comprehensive market analysis services. 
It does not provide buy/sell recommendations. However, it monitors stock prices, notifies users, and provides news articles not only about 
the stock they are following but also about the company to which it belongs. This feature can help users understand the factors leading to
changes in stock prices.
