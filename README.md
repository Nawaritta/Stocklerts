# Stocklerts

## The context
![](./static/assets/img/about-bg.jpg)

## Project Overview:

Stocklerts derives its name from the combination of 'stock trading' and 'news alerts.' As the name suggests, the core idea of the project is to provide users with real-time stock price data and pertinant news, facilitating informed decision-making. In other words,
the project aims to tackle the challenge of creating a DIY Bloomberg Terminal for individual traders.

The application is not a substitute for professional financial advice, stock market predictions, or comprehensive market analysis services. It does not provide buy/sell recommendations. However, it monitors stock prices, notifies users, and provides news articles not only about the stock they are following but also about the company to which it belongs. This feature can help users understand the factors leading to changes in stock prices.


## Tools and Resources:

__API Integration__:

To ensure that users receive timely and pertinent information for making informed trading decisions, the project integrates two APIs:
   - Alpha Vantage for market data
   - News API for relevant news updates.
